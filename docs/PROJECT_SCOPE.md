# üõ∞Ô∏è ARK ECOSYSTEM ‚Äì PROJECT SCOPE

> ‚ÄúEven the smallest module can shape the destiny of the fleet.‚Äù

## MISSION STATEMENT

Empower all Commanders with a modular, persistent, open-source digital fleet‚Äîcentered on ROM building but ready for any mission. The ARK is the standard for automation, device management, and collaborative operations in the open-source universe.

## CURRENT FEATURES

- Modular, menu-driven launcher
- Persistent tmux session for all modules
- Theming (Cadet/Expert Mode, toggle)
- ARK Forge: ROM build automation (Smart/Recovery/ROM/Sync/Resume)
- ARK Orbital Command: Diagnostics, drivers, provisioning, telemetry
- Unified error handling
- Flexible build directories (default: ~/home/android/<rom>-<device>)
- **Universal ARK Quote System:** Motivational, thematic quotes across the fleet

## GOALS & ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

- **Resume Build:** Implement full resumption of interrupted builds.
- **Sync Only:** Repo sync integration, incremental and full.
- **Module Error Trapping:** Consistent, user-friendly error compliance in all modules.
- **Cadet Mode Automation:** Automate repetitive steps and onboarding.
- **Mode Evolution:** Enhance features and prompts for both modes.
- **Persistent State:** Build logs, device status, and progress tracking.
- **Global Quote Customization:** Allow Commanders to easily add quotes.
