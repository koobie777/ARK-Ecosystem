# üõ∞Ô∏è ARK ECOSYSTEM ‚Äì PROJECT SCOPE

> ‚ÄúEven the smallest script can shape the destiny of the fleet.‚Äù

## MISSION STATEMENT

Empower all Commanders with a modular, persistent, open-source digital fleet‚Äîcentered on Android ROM building, device management, and rapid module evolution.  
The ARK sets the standard for automation, orchestration, diagnostics, collaborative learning, and device management in the open-source universe.

## CURRENT FEATURES

- Modular, menu-driven launcher (persistent tmux session)
- Unified ARK theming (Cadet/Expert mode toggle, quote system)
- ARK Forge: ROM build automation (Smart/Recovery/ROM/Sync/Resume)
- ARK Orbital Command: Diagnostics, drivers, provisioning, telemetry
- ARK Essentials: Stable, flagship modules (promoted via essentials protocol)
- ARK Theming Engine: Unified UI and error formatting for all modules
- System-Bay Submodules:  
  - Any script dropped into a system-bay directory inherits its parent dir name and can be promoted or demoted at will.
  - Drag-and-drop protocol for instant fleet evolution.
- Embedded/Baked-In Features:  
  - Functions or code blocks can exist inside main modules and be promoted/demoted as needed.
- Sibling Scripts:  
  - Standalone scripts next to main module scripts, instantly promotable or demotable.
- Flexible build directories (default: ~/home/android/<rom>-<device>)
- Universal ARK Quote System: Motivational, thematic quotes and guidance
- Desktop/Start Menu/Taskbar shortcut integration for ease of access
- Mission-LT compliance: All modules/submodules maintain changelog.md and protocol documentation

## GOALS & ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

- **Promotion/Demotion Pipeline:** System-bay/embedded/sibling ‚Üí Experimental (dock) ‚Üí Essentials ‚Üí Core protocol, and vice versa.
- **Resume Build:** Full resumption of interrupted builds.
- **Sync Only:** Repo sync integration, incremental and full.
- **Module Error Trapping:** Consistent, user-friendly error compliance in all modules.
- **Cadet Mode Automation:** Automate onboarding and repetitive steps.
- **Mode Evolution:** Expand and refine features/prompts for all modes.
- **Persistent State:** Build logs, device status, and fleet-wide progress tracking.
- **Global Quote Customization:** Allow Commanders to easily add and share quotes.
- **Cross-platform:** Containerized builds‚ÄîDocker, WSL, Mac, Linux.
- **Changelog Protocol:** Every module/submodule tracks updates in changelog.md for transparency and history.
- **Modular Mobility:** Encourage all contributors to move, promote, or demote features and modules as fleet needs evolve.
