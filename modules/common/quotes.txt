May The ARK guide your builds through any cosmic storm.
A persistent session is a persistent spirit!
Every fleet needs a flagship. Welcome aboard The ARK Supreme Mk1.
In the darkness between stars, our protocols are the light.
Even the smallest module can shape the destiny of the fleet.
Errors are just cosmic waypoints—let’s course-correct, Commander.
The ARK is for every voyager—bring your device, bring your dream.
All modules return to The ARK. All journeys begin anew.
If you can dream it, you can build it—on The ARK.
No device left behind. No build lost to the void.
United by protocol, powered by imagination—The ARK is your fleet.
When in doubt, return to the main menu—The ARK awaits.
"Cadet or Expert, your choices shape the stars."
There are no errors, only opportunities for guidance.
The ARK never sleeps, and neither does your progress.
