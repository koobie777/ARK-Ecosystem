## üõ∏ The ARK Vision

- **Persistent:** All operations run in a single tmux session. Never lose progress.
- **Modular:** Drop-in modules for any mission‚ÄîROMs, diagnostics, automation, security, and beyond.
- **Collaborative & Themed:** Built for all Commanders, open to every contributor. All features and UI should remain in ARK theming and spirit.
- **Inspirational:** Universal ARK quotes inspire and guide at every step.
- **Legendary:** Designed to set the standard for open-source build and fleet automation.

---

## üöÄ Onboarding

1. **Clone The ARK Ecosystem with submodules:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules <this-repo-url>
   ```
2. **Launch The ARK:**
   ```bash
   ./ark-launcher.sh
   ```
   - Use `--theme expert` for minimal prompts; default is Cadet Mode for full ARK guidance.

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Key Protocols

- **Single tmux Session:** All modules operate within the same session‚Äînever exit, always return to the ARK Main Menu.
- **Theming:**  
    - **Cadet Mode:** Guided, ARK-themed onboarding for new users  
    - **Expert Mode:** Minimal prompts, rapid execution for advanced users  
    - Seamless mode toggle (`--theme cadet|expert`)
- **Unified Quote System:**  
    - Random ARK quotes will appear at launch, on menus, and after key actions across all modules.
    - Contribute your own quotes in `modules/common/quotes.txt`!
- **Unified Error Handling:**  
    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è [ERROR TYPE]
    Location: [component]
    Fix: [solution]
    "I'll guide you, Commander."
    ```
    - Errors never exit ARK session‚Äîalways return to Main Menu, always guide the user.
- **Flexibility:** Override default directories, bring any device or build to the fleet.
- **Expansion:** Future modules are pre-defined and ready for contribution.
- **Contribution Theming:** All features and changes must maintain ARK theming and spirit.
